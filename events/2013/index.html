</p>
<p>This talk gives an overview on the state of the QEMU USB subsystem. What
happened last year? What are the plans for the future? Where do we stand
in terms of USB 3.0 support?</p>

<p>The intended audience are people who are interested in USB in virtual
machines (vusb) both developers and users. The audience is expected to
be familiar with generic virtualization concepts, but no deep technical
knowledge is required.</p>

<p>Speaker self introduction: Hans has been a Linux developer since 1996,
working on a wide variety of projects, including maintaining 200
packages in Fedora, various hwmon kernel drivers, rewriting and merging
many out of tree webcam drivers into the mainline kernel, libv4l a
userspace library to transparently handle the decompression of many
proprietary webcam video formats in userspace.</p>

<p>Since 2008 Hans works for Red Hat, besides continuing all the FOSS work
he did before, at Red Hat he has worked on anaconda the Fedora / Red Hat
installer, parted (the partition tool) and currently works on Spice and
USB-redirection under QEMU.</p>

<p>Personas were made famous by Alan Moore in "The Inmates are Running the
Asylum", a seminal book on user interface design for computer
programmers. They have been used for decades in the marketing industry
to help target specific market segments with ads and products. Personas
help you frame feature discussions while developing your software, guide
your communication and conference strategy, and ultimately help you to
have a more popular, better project.</p>

<p>This presentation will cover the basics of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is a persona?</li>
  <li>How do I come up with one (or several) for my project?</li>
  <li>What can I do with them?</li>

</p>
<p>Java packaging in Linux has never been trivial. Partially due to strict
principles that most Linux distributions adhere to, partially due to
Java ecosystem encouraging behavior which goes against these principles,
but mostly due to ineffective tooling on both sides of the fence.</p>

<p>Over past 2 years, tooling and guidelines for packaging Java have
changed in Fedora Linux considerably. What used to be a 1000 line build
script can soon become 100 lines of mostly metadata. But all of that
relies on sane build system with predictable behavior on Java side:
Maven.</p>

<p>During the course of the talk we will clean up one such build script and
describe how each change was made possible. Most importantly we hope to
convince the audience that for common good, using Maven for Java
development even with all its quirks is better than the alternatives. A
wider discussion on Java build systems would also be welcome.</p>

<p>Live storage migration, one of the newest features introduced in oVirt,
is the capability of moving virtual disks from one storage device to
another without interrupting the guest operations. This presentation
will cover in detail the entire low level design and implementation and
all the technical challenges associated with them. In a virtualization
world where the guest services cannot be stopped for maintenance, live
storage migration is the best tool you can have.</p>

</p>
<p>ARM's new, 64 bit ARMv8 architecture, is a break from the past in two
regards. The change of scale from 32 to 64 bit implies a broadening of
ARM's target market from (mostly) embedded devices to address the
requirements of high end consumer devices and servers. The 64 bit mode
(AArch64) programming model is significantly different from the existing
32 bit model.</p>

<p>If ARM's change of direction does indeed grab a significant share of
this market then there are two corresponding implications for the Free
Java community. We need a high quality free Java implementation to
ensure that the market is not colonised solely by commercial Java
vendors. We need to provide this implementation from scratch rather than
try to modify existing 32 bit Java implementations.</p>

<p>Red Hat has decided to port OpenJDK to AArch64 precisely to meet these
implications head on.</p>

<p>This talk will describe the significant progress we have made in porting
OpenJDK to AArch64 since the project began in earnest in July 2012, even
though real hardware is not yet available and will not be for many
months to come.</p>

<p>During the talk we will:</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Outline our plan for converting the runtime JIT components of OpenJDK to
generate AArch64 code – the (generated AArch64 code) template
interpreter and the C1/C2 JIT compilers</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Explain how we have already managed to execute and debug generated ARM
code using our own ARMv8 functional simulator integrated into an x86 JVM</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Display execution of a Java program using the template interpreter
running on our simulator</p>

<ul>
  <li></li>
</ul>

<p>Show both ARM instruction-level and Java bytecode-level stepping and
debugging of generated code within gdb</p>

<b>Speaker: Radek Pazdera</b>
</p>
<p>In this presentation, we would like to introduce a tool we have been
working on for the last couple of months. Our main goal is to make
networking tests and reproducers as automated and portable as possible.</p>

<p>Testing network stacks requires a fair amount of configuration to be
done on multiple machines. The configuration itself is a part of the
test. However, it is often highly dependent on the environment and
unfortunately, when the environment changes (due to move to a different
hardware/site, changes in the addressing, or simply updates of the
operating system) the configuration often breaks.</p>

<p>With LNST, we try to overcome these problems of transferring network
configuration between different environments. We will demonstrate the
ideas and the concepts we are working with, as well as the features that
are a part of Linux Network Stack Test.</p>

<p>Maintaining QoS in cloud computing requires host-level monitoring and
policy enforcement. In order to be able to scale up large setups, a
host-level agent is needed to supervise and dynamically handle the VMs
resource consumption based on the SLA policy.</p>

<p>In this session we'll look at MoM, and get in-depth view of its
integration with VDSM and functionalities. Participants will be able to
get insights on memory overcommitment in hypervisors and the way memory
balloon device is being used to achieve overcommitment.</p>

<p>This session will provide an intro to the oVirt project components and
features. The oVirt Project is an open virtualization project providing
a feature-rich server and desktop virtualization management platform
with advanced capabilities for hosts and guests, including high
availability, live migration, storage management, system scheduler, and
more. oVirt provides an integration point for several open source
virtualization technologies, including KVM, libvirt, spice and oVirt
node. oVirt was launched in November 2011 as a fully open source
project, based on assets from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager
platform. The project has an open governance model, and initial board
has members from IBM, Cisco, NetApp, Red Hat and SUSE.</p>

<p>Since mid-2011 (when Gary Benson, the original author of Zero/Shark)
left Red Hat's Java team), the Zero interpreter and Shark compiler have
been basically unmaintained. A few months ago I picked up the project
and fixed the outstanding issues (related to changes in Hotspot and
LLVM) and started implementing a couple of significant improvements.</p>

<p>This talk will give a short summary about what Zero and Shark actually
are, how they work, why they are relevant (even in the face of upcoming
full ports for PowerPC and others), how it fits in the OpenJDK
ecosystem, and then describe some of the more interesting details about
what I did, in particular improved support for atomic operations, JSR
292/invokedynamic, interesting optimizations in both the compiler and
the interpreter and more. Hopefully I will be able to present some
interesting ports to other platforms like ARM or PowerPC, some
benchmarks results as well as results from testsuites (TCK?). Finally,
I'll give an outlook to the future, things that need to be done, open
improvements, optimizations, etc.</p>

<b>Speaker: Leslie Hawthorn (with Lydia Pintscher, KDE & Wikimedia)</b>
</p>
<p>Headed to your annual developer conference and there’s a contentious
topic on everyone’s mind? Wondering how to get past the airing of
grievances into a useful discussion?</p>

<p>In this talk, Lydia Pintscher and Leslie Hawthorn will explore
facilitation techniques to use during community wide discussions.
Drawing on the principles of [open space
technology](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-space_technology)</a> they
will explore several methods for achieving consensus while still having
fun, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spectragrams</li>
  <li>Dot-o-cracy</li>
  <li>Post-It</li>
  <li>Mind mapping</li>
  <li>more</li>
</ul>

<p>The talk will be accompanied by live demos of each technique. Audience
participation will be requested but not required. Participants who wish
to learn more about the topics to be discussed in advance of the
presentation may wish to visit [the Aspiration Technology
wiki](<a href="http://facilitation.aspiration.org)">http://facilitation.aspiration.org)</a> for more details.</p>

<p>GlusterFS is a distributed file system that can scale to several
petabytes. oVirt is a management platform for Kernel based Virtual
Machine (KVM) and can be used to manage GlusterFS as well.</p>

<p>This talk will focus on GlusterFS integration with oVirt. GlusterFS and
KVM virtualization users and developers will be able to get more
information on GlusterFS concepts, enabling it in oVirt for
virtualization, a short overview of oVirt and VDSM architecture
including VDSM storage concepts. This will be followed by GlusterFS as a
VDSM Storage Domain, as well as GlusterFS domain support in oVirt
engine.</p>

<p>This presentation examines current challenges in Open Source security
and sketches ideas to address them.</p>

<p>Linux distributions deal with a large number of code bases predominantly
written by others, some of them huge. This makes it difficult to address
vulnerabilities in a consistent fashion. There is increasing demand for
difficult-to-use technology, such as cryptography, and more and more
upstream projects are forced to deal with vulnerabilities in their code.</p>

<p>How do you build a comprehensive and coherent Identity Management System
on Linux? This is the question I started answering 7 years ago when I
joined Red Hat, and is still being worked on today. In this talk I will
present a broad overview of all the aspects of Identity Management that
need to be considered to have a full end-to-end solution, for the server
components (Kerberos, LDAP, DNS, Management components, etc..) that are
managed under the umbrella of the FreeIPA project to the client
components (SSSD and utilities) and all the other hidden parts (like
GSS-Proxy, Samba libraries) that are normally not easily visible but
that become needed once you get down to playing with the bits. The talk
will go down into the technical details and the whys and hows of the
whole architecture.</p>

<p>The advent of IaaS has brought about a new style of application
architecture built around the idea that the components of your
architecture should be fine-grained programmable resources. This allows
applications to be resilient and scalable, but also allows the operation
of the application to be fully automated.</p>

<p>Mark will discuss how OpenStack was designed from the ground up with
these same principles in mind and can be deployed in a highly resilient
and fault tolerant manner. Mark will go on to explain how you should aim
to build on OpenStack's architecture so that operating an OpenStack
cloud is as automated as operating a modern cloud based application.</p>

<p>A tale of sadness and a tale of joy: the tale of invokedynamic use in
JRuby and a few other projects since the first prototypes dropped in
2008. I started experimenting with invokedynamic in JRuby in version
1.1.5, early in the JSR-292 process, and kept up with changes as they
arrived. Today, JRuby utilizes invokedynamic for several aspects of the
Ruby language, and we're finding more ways to use it every day. I'll
talk about where we've been and where we're going…what works and what
doesn't…and how to understand everything happening under the covers.</p>

<p>Last year, we shared with the Free Java and the global OSS community our
vision for a new open source monitoring and instrumentation tool for
anyone running an open Java stack, along with our fledgeling
implementation. Since then, we've been hard at work making this vision a
reality. Our project has undergone various transformations, including
becoming modular not just in terms of deployment but also from a source
code perspective with the help of OSGi, a complete overhaul of the API
for extending Thermostat, and an amazing visual makeover – attendees
from last year may have trouble recognizing it on sight. Along the way
we've also added new, compelling features such as detailed thread
monitoring, heap dump and analysis, an Eclipse plugin interface, and
more functionality available from the command line. Of course, we also
had a lot of fun doing it.</p>

<p>In our talk, we will describe the current state of Thermostat, give a
demo of what you can do out of the box, and build a toy plugin on the
spot so that attendees can see how easy it is to add custom
instrumentation.</p>

<p>In a world where Cloud IaaS providers are popping up on every street
corner, it becomes increasingly important to prevent vendor lock-in.
Several efforts are already underway in projects like Deltacloud to help
abstract away the differences in APIs and allow consumers to be cloud
agnostic.</p>

<p>However, the desire for cloud agnosticism becomes increasingly
challenging when we start thinking about managing images. Not only do we
have API differences, but also many cloud vendors require differing
formats and importation methods, some requiring uploading of pre-built
images, others snapshots of running instances.</p>

<p>This talk addresses some of the issues surrounding image management in a
federated cloud environment and introduces Aeolus Image Factory; a
project that offers image management abstraction for multitude of Cloud
vendors. Aeolus Image Factory allows users to define images at a high
level and have them built, pushed and registered with all the major
cloud vendors.</p>

</p>
<p>Deploying complex systems on OpenStack can be a challenge.</p>

<p>A small website running MediaWiki can happily fit on a single server,
but the same software running at the Wikipedia scale is much more
demanding. You need to deal with multiple database servers, web servers,
load balancers, failover, networking configuration, IP address
assignment and more.</p>

<p>The Heat project allows you to describe all the resources and their
relationships in a single template, launch everything with one command
and keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with existing
configuration management tools such as Puppet or Chef.</p>

<p>Initially modeled after Amazon CloudFormation, Heat is a free and open
source component for OpenStack and has recently been accepted into
OpenStack incubation.</p>

<p>This session will provide an overview of Heat's capabilities and how to
use them, followed by a live demonstration. At the end you will
understand Heat well enough to decide whether it is useful in your
environment and how to get started with it.</p>

<p>Many GNU/Linux distributions include a cross-compilation environment for
Windows that is easy to install and use. Some of these also provide the
Nullsoft installer (NSIS) to package build artifacts into a Windows
executable. NSIS has the advantage that the compiler is portable to
POSIX systems, but does not support corporate deployment and component
management as well as .msi packages generated for the Windows Installer.
libmsi is a port of Wine's MSI database code. The talk will present the
rationale for the library, its current state and msitools, a small set
of programs that we implemented around it. We will also present plans
for future development of libmsi and msitools, and its inclusion in
Fedora-MinGW project.</p>

<p>Ceilometer is an OpenStack incubated project which started in April 2012
with the goal to provide a unique interface point to provide measurement
in OpenStack. Our purpose for measurement started with a focus on
metering (for billing) and has since been extended to other targets such
as monitoring and alerting. This project is a collaboration of a wide
variety of actors.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction of the project past and future, this talk
will introduce the audience to the project's architecture before digging
into how and why they can contribute to its future.</p>

<p>Whilst the mantra of free and open source software communities focus on
transparency and collaboration, community leaders will often find that
the most significant conversations are those they have 1/1 and "behind
closed doors." As a community leader, one is called upon to be both
trusted confidant and change agent, and being effective in both roles
simultaneously can be a quite difficult – and deeply humorous – dance.
Join Leslie Hawthorn as she explores the nuances of public and private
discourse in FOSS projects, using real world examples from her
experience interacting with more than 200 communities over the past six
years.</p>

software, open source software provides the freedom to use, modify, and
redistribute the code, giving customers an opportunity to engage in the
product development process and preview future Red Hat products.</p>

<p>In this session, Dave Neary will discuss community projects that Red Hat
has sponsored and participated in, including oVirt, OpenStack, JBoss
Application Server, LibreOffice, GNOME, and Fedora. Attendees will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discover the benefits of using community-developed software and
engaging with upstream communities</li>
  <li>Learn about how French services company AlterWay built a public cloud
offering on oVirt</li>
  <li>Preview upcoming Red Hat product features</li>
  <li>Learn about how to influence the development of future features by

<p>George R. R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire” series, and the HBO
television series, makes for great entertainment — if a little bloody
and short on happy endings. Though the “Game of Thrones” characters
inhabit a universe that hasn’t even seen gunpowder yet, a lot of the
lessons learned in GoT also apply to building, deploying, and
maintaining an IaaS cloud. This talk will take a humorous approach, but
also give attendees some crucial insights into moving from traditional
IT to cloud computing.</p>

<p>Cloud computing as an industry phenomenon is built almost entirely on
open source pieces, but ironically (or perhaps, perversely) is used to
create proprietary services. This talk shows how the four software
freedoms achieved a more level playing field for software users and
developers and provided a solid foundation on which innovation
flourished. Innovation was an interesting by-product, not something
pursued. Unfortunately, the four software freedoms are not enough to
compel open cloud services. The lessons learned from open source should
be used to achieve a level playing field in cloud computing.</p>

<p>Resource management is highly relevant on both large servers (where many
resources need to be distributed among an even higher number of
consumers to get the maximum out of the invested infrastructure) and on
small embedded devices (where few resources need to be distributed among
many consumers). Newer systemd versions support resource management
out-of-the-box, as first-class functionality of service management. In
this talk we will show you how to make use of it. We will tell you how
to dynamically assign resource limits to running services and virtual
machines and how to reliably determine the current resource usage of
your services and virtual machines. We will introduce you to new
concepts such as "Slices" which you can use to create arbitrary resource
partition hierarchies. And we will give you a bit of background on what
actually happens on the lower level.</p>

<p>Maintaining QoS in cloud computing requires host-level monitoring and
policy enforcement. In order to be able to scale up large setups, a
host-level agent is needed to supervise and dynamically handle the VMs
resource consumption based on the SLA policy. In this session we'll take
oVirt as an example of private cloud with a need for SLA. We'll look
into SLA challenges of the cloud, and then at MoM as a host-level
enforcement agent. As an agent we'll review MoM's integration with VDSM
and policies. Participants will be able to get insights cloud SLA
challenges, ans some resolutions such as memory overcommitment in
hypervisors.</p>

<p>It's finally here! OpenShift is built on open source and here's your
chance to learn how to take the code and projects that power OpenShift
to build your own PaaS. Come check out this session with Grant Shipley
from the OpenShift team to learn where to download, how to install, and
how to configure and deploy onto your local machine(s). We'll cover the
fundamentals of how to deploy apps onto your PaaS to make it do
something useful for you. We'll cover ways to extend your PaaS by adding
support for customized middleware, databases, frameworks and languages.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi was designed as an inexpensive device to teach kids
Python. It's become a device of choice for hardware tinkerers and
hackers of all sorts of experience levels to integrate a fully
functional Linux computer into their projects. I'll give you some
inspiration with a few project ideas. Then I'll start with the basic,
most important Pi tricks, like making sure you have the right SD card
and that you've chosen the best distro for the job you intend to do up
through some more challenging problems, like what happens when you need
to build a cross-compiler or a custom kernel. Not that those things are
crucial to having fun with a Pi, and whether you're new to the board or
already used it to power your home automation system, you'll learn a few
new ideas in this session.</p>

<p>Managing storage resources in Linux has traditionally been the realm of
storage teams with deep expertise in the magic of external and internal
RAID arrays and external filers. Technologies like hyper-scale,
openstack and virtualization make it harder than ever to provision,
manage during run time and repair storage. This talk will give a
detailed overview of several upstream projects that are working on
providing all of these environments, as well as traditional bare metal
servers, an easy to use way to set up, run and debug storage and file
systems. Status updates on the component projects and their roadmaps
will also be shared.</p>

<p>PaaS has rightly been celebrated as a way to increase developer
productivity and thereby help companies get the new applications and
services they need online (and making money) faster. But PaaS goes
beyond developers and beyond dev/test. Efficient application
multi-tenancy and auto-scaling are also key features for production
environments. Furthermore, PaaS also means that platform changes can
happen without affecting developers, a big win for architects and
procurement officers. In short, PaaS is for everyone. This session will
help attendees understand how the PaaS landscape is evolving to provide
solutions with appeal across many facets of the IT organization and
beyond. It will touch on key technical enablers that are making this
possible but will focus predominantly on how organizations are using
PaaS today and the benefits that they are seeing by doing so.</p>

Live Snapshots is considered to be one of the most powerful features in
oVirt, making it possible to take a snapshot for a VM while the VM is
running. oVirt 3.3 introduces a major enhancement to oVirt Live
Snapshots: now they can contain the state of the memory of the VM in
addition to the state of its disks. The presentation includes
interesting technical aspects of the feature, and explain how it can be
used: * Brief overview of oVirt architecture * Overview of oVirt
Snapshots &amp; Live Snapshots * Deep dive into the technical process of
creating and restoring Live Snapshots with Memory * Guidance how to
make simple and advanced snapshots related operations via UI &amp; REST API</p>

<p>Converged infrastructure is an idea for virtualization infrastructure
that is enabling organizations to deploy more rapidly on a single
commodity hardware platform for both compute and storage infrastructure.
Until recently this was something that was difficult to do with Open
Source software. This presentation provides an overview of what a
converged infrastructure solution looks like and then digs into the Open
Source software that can be used to build successful converged
solutions. With Gluster and oVirt as foundational software packages the
presentation will dig into advanced scenarios for deploying virtual
machines as well as adding additional nodes for both storage and
compute. OpenStack networking, image management, and object store will
be tied in as well to demonstrate the advantages of using Open Source to
solve your organization's virtualization challenges.</p>

<p>Time has come to start thinking about multiple data storage solutions
while building applications. A single application can use multiple data
storage technologies depending on its use case – right tool for right
job. The session will start by introducing polyglot persistence to the
audience. Next we will cover the pros and cons of Polyglot persistence.
Then we will see how to build location aware Job search application
using MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Solr. The different data storage
solutions are used to persist different types of data like MongoDB to
store Job data along with its location, PostgreSQL to store User data,
Redis as a cache for User objects and other goodies, and Solr as a full
text search engine. Finally, the application will be deployed to
OpenShift – open source Platform as a Service.</p>

<p>As an industry, we’ve mostly moved on from naive notions about cloud
computing being inherently “safe” or “risky.” However, more
sophisticated discussions require both greater nuance and greater rigor.
This presentation takes attendees through frameworks for evaluating and
mitigating potential issues in hybrid cloud environments, discusses key
risk factors to consider, and describes some of the relevant standards
and provider certifications. This is a broad and sometimes complex
topic. However, it’s very manageable if individual risk factors are
considered systematically and specifically. This session will give IT
professionals tools and knowledge to help them make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Nested Virtualzation involves three levels – The physical host (L0),
running a guest hypervisor (L1), and its associated 'nested' guest (L2).
This is useful in several ways: a cloud user can get a guest hypervisor
and can manage a variety of guests for development/test without the
intervention of the cloud provider; enable live migration of
hypervisors; ability to have an entire virtualization setup - a
hypervisor and all its guests in a single virtual machine. Support for
nVMX (Intel based Nested Virtualization) was first introduced around two
years ago in KVM. Since then, there have been improvements in the
Kernel, and also in the hardware space. This session discusses
observations from recent testing of some workloads with upstream KVM
with newest Intel hardware in a Linux-on-Linux environment. Finally, a
glimpse of upcoming improvements in this space.</p>

<p>Linux is usually the first target for vendors with the most cutting edge
types of storage and file system technologies. The community was the
first to bring parallel NFS into production quality and has been at the
bleeding edge of dealing with very high speed, low latency storage
devices like PCI-e SSDs. This talk gives an overview of two new
technologies at the opposite ends of the speed and capacity spectrum:
DRAM class persistent memory and very dense "shingled" drives. The talk
gives an overview of what the technologies are, what the ongoing work is
in upstream and some of the choices we have in supporting these new
devices. Finally, the talk will give an overview of how these new
technologies are likely to be deployed both in traditional, enterprise
servers and in the hardware that underpins modern cloud systems.</p>

hackers of all sorts of experience levels to integrate a fully
functional Linux computer into their projects. I'll give you some
inspiration with a few project ideas. Then I'll start with the basic,
most important Pi tricks, like making sure you have the right SD card
and that you've chosen the best distro for the job you intend to do up
through some more challenging problems, like what happens when you need
to build a cross-compiler or a custom kernel. Not that those things are
crucial to having fun with a Pi, and whether you're new to the board or
already used it to power your home automation system, you'll learn a few

<p>systemd-nspawn is a simple container manager for Linux systems that is
shipped as built-in component of systemd. systemd-nspawn is as easy to
use as chroots, but suitable for booting up full-blown Linux systems.
It's great as light-weight container tool that just works.
systemd-nspawn makes working with containers easy. In this presentation
I will introduce you to systemd-nspawn, and show how you can set up a
bootable Linux container in a one command, and then boot it up in a
second one – and all that with built-in tools of your favourite
(systemd-based) distribution. You might learn a thing or two about Linux
containers in general, and the technology they build on. We'll discuss
how we are working on integrating container support as closely into the
core OS as possible, trying to provide similar integration as Zones on
Solaris.</p>

<p>Cloud computing as an industry phenomenon is built almost entirely on
open source pieces, but ironically (or perhaps, perversely) is used to
create proprietary services. This talk shows how the four software
freedoms achieved a more level playing field for software users and
developers and provided a solid foundation on which innovation
flourished. Innovation was an interesting by-product, not something
pursued. Unfortunately, the four software freedoms are not enough to
compel open cloud services. The lessons learned from open source should
be used to achieve a level playing field in cloud computing.</p>

<p>Should you learn a new skill set to develop mobile applications? Or can
you use your existing skillset and convert your HTML5 + REST mobile web
app to hybrid app? Learning a new skill set can be very frustrating and
time consuming. In this session Shekhar Gulati, Principal OpenShift

existing HTML5 + RESTful Web application to a Hybrid app using Apache
Cordova. Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile
applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Restful backend of the
application will be running on OpenShift – Red Hat's open source public
Platform as a Service.</p>

<p>We've come a long, long way since the days of installing software by
compiling source nd shoving it onto a system with <code>make install</code>.
Last year, Docker containers were heralded as a way out of the
complexities of managing software - but today we're faced with
a slew of container offerings and things look more complex than
ever. What's the solution? In this presentation we'll look at
a number of next-generation technologies for managing applications,
such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>OStree/rpm-ostree</li>
  <li>Software Collections</li>
  <li>Docker, Rocket, and LXC</li>
  <li>dnf</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll talk about the options in front of developers and admins
today, how they can navigate all the new shiny technologies that
promise better software delivery and management, and what the rest
of 2015 is likely to bring.</p>

<p>Certain scheduling tasks, such as selecting the host to launch a new
VM or receive a migrating VM, are central to every cloud and
virtualization management system. These systems use rules to make
scheduling decisions, but rules alone leave certain efficiency gains
unrealized. Version 3.5 of oVirt, the open source virtual datacenter
management system, included a new VM scheduling optimizer based on
the OptaPlanner project. While working within policy constraints set
by an administrator, this service performs probabalistic analysis of
the environment to suggest how best to assign host resources.</p>

describe how they work, and even point out some of the unique
licenses on the fringe of our universe. Bonus: he's been reading
Legalese for years (as a non-lawyer who regularly works with
lawyers at Red Hat), so he can translate licenses back to English.</p>

<p>GlusterFS was developed as a distributed filesystem in the oil and gas/high 
performance compute arena. Using GlusterFS, flexible distributed storage can 
easily be set up using commodity x86 hardware. Simple, inexpensive internal 
or JBOD storage can be linked across multiple physical servers and presented 
as a single storage namespace. This storage can be used for log file, web 
content, virtual machine, and other storage use cases. Red Hat's Thomas 
Cameron will demonstrate the steps involved in installing Gluster, configuring 
disks, linking the Gluster nodes, defining storage bricks, and presenting that 
storage to clients. He'll talk about tips and tricks, best practices, backup 
and recovery, and more.</p>

<p>Do you cringe when you see #hashtags? Do you roll your eyes at "social media gurus"? 
Social media should save time (not suck it), but you don't have to be a community 
manager or have a communications background to leverage the power of 140 characters. 
With a few quick and easy tips, your open source project can use social media to 
communicate with contributors, grow its community, and share news and announcements.
Already love IRC and email lists? Great! This talk will explain how using social media – 
such as Twitter, G+, and Facebook – can complement those good ole reliable communication 
methods. You also will learn how to determine which social media accounts your project 
needs, what content to post (and when to post it), who to follow, and how to determine 
whether your approach is working. Find out how to avoid being the center of an ugly 
Twitter storm (or pull yourself out when it's too late), and how to keep from being 
super boring or becoming a spamtastic yawn fest. Using well-known open source projects 
as examples, this talk will show how one account doubled its followers in three months, 
and a new open source project had 435 followers the week it launched. This talk 
provides a crash course in social media to help your project effectively manage its 
messages and connect with its community.

<p>The tone and tenor of conversations in a community is a large part of whether a 
community succeeds, yet that’s often a hard concept to model and understand. Using a 
humorous approach, Gina will demonstrate behaviors that create a hostile community 
(and by contrast, those that create a welcoming community). She’ll look at the<br />
Defcon Insult Scale for Conversations (the DIScon level), from mildly insulting to 
abusive, and at key signifiers of each level. Audience members will be encouraged to 
share their own perceptions of how it feels to be at different DIScon levels. Then she'll 
tackle the more subtle forms of riling folks up (ways you can assume ignorance, belittle 
people, and/or just be condescending). She's even created a starter list of helpful 
phrases that people can use as writing prompts when they want to ensure that folks take 
things the wrong way (phrases like “You may have noticed” and “I’d just like to point out” 
and “I don’t mean to be [a pedant, sexist, etc], but…”). She'll conclude with steps 
individuals can take to reduce the “DIScon level” of the communities in which they participate.</p>

<p>Distribution build systems are interesting  beasts, complex and with many moving parts. 
In the past year, containers, Project Atomic, and other changes have forced a rapid<br />
evolution in how we consume source and deliver a distribution. This talk will take a look 
at the entire chain of building a distribution from start to finish. Ian will look at how 
source is packaged and built, and then how complex combinations of packages are joined 
together to make a cohesive Linux distribution that successfully installs and runs in a 
diverse set of environments - from aging x86 hardware to public cloud environments, Linux 
containers, and immutable systems. He'll talk about the security considerations, collaboration 
between hundreds (thousands?) of packagers, and working on the engine while the car is running.</p>

<p>The difference between the scale up model used in virtual datacenter management tools 
like oVirt and vSphere and the cloud's scale out model used in OpenStack and CloudStack 
has historially used the pets versus cattle model. But what if there was another way to 
describe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? In this pop-culture talk, 
Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and present the idea that it's the starships of Starfleet 
and the fighters of the Empire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities 
of virtual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line with the starships 
of Starfleet: large, dedicated ships that have an intense amount of investment, not just in 
the ships themselves, but in the crews that man them. These ships are multifunctional, dedicated 
to exploration, defense, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs, weaponry, and 
very diverse crews, these ships are designed to function autonomously in a a variety of situations.
Compare that with the ships of the Empire or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly 
lower investment in crews. On the Empire side, there is very little diversity, with ships and 
weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literally cut from the same cloth, 
and there is very little autonomy on any scale. The Alliance is slightly better, but their ships 
seems aligned to counter the Empire model, and so fall into the same "disposable" model. Crew 
diversity is infinitely better, but the barrier to entry seems a little low ("let's give the kid 
from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal training!"). In many respects, these fictional 
universes represent how VMs are treated in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a 
light-hearted and totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environments.</p>

<p>At a glance, the maker movement seems open source by nature, full of contributors sharing 
their creations and building from one another. But the reality is quite different. Many 
(if not most) makers are unfamiliar with open source software even as users, much less with 
how to implement its principles within their projects. The apparently crossover is indeed a 
natural fit, thought, and there is much benefit in building communities around tangible projects 
on open source principles. Of course, there are also different sets of challenges from those 
faced by software communities. New sets of legal issues arise for open hardware projects. 
Communities unfamiliar with the evolution of open source projects panic when their goods are 
cloned. There are also project management and build issues larger than those faced by software 
projects that only have to handle bits and bytes and not pieces and parts; however, we can see a 
lot of hope and gain direction from those who have been successful, from groups like the Open 
Prosthetics Project to the wildly successful Arduino and Raspberry Pi ecosystems. These 
types of communities set the example for the success of open source in maker communities, 
and as a result, the success of maker communities' projects for the greater good.</p>

<p>Open Source is a phenomenon made possible by defined freedoms, managed ecosystems, and the 
elevation of customers to the same status as developers and vendors, leading to a world where 
all participants collaborate on open source projects. This innovation was a happy accident: 
end users were able to collaborate in this way because of the establishment of the four 
freedoms and the resulting managed ecosystem of open source platforms. The resulting changes 
in development process led to open source becoming the dominant way to innovate in software. 
Ultimately, open source is a victory of process, governance and agility, which are at least as 
important as the code. But what lessons can we take away from open source domination, especially 
as we push forward in the cloud era? If the four freedoms drove open source development, will 
they play the same role in the advancement of cloud computing? In this talk, John Mark will look 
at examples from the cloud computing world and history. Is the secret to innovation the creation 
of sound processes and good governance?</p>

</p>
<p>Ceph is designed around the assumption that all components of the system (disks, hosts, 
networks) can fail, and has traditionally leveraged replication to provide data durability 
and reliability. The CRUSH placement algorithm is used to allow failure domains to be defined 
across hosts, racks, rows, or datacenters, depending on the deployment scale and requirements. 
Recent releases have added support for erasure coding, which can provide much higher data 
durability and lower storage overheads. However, in practice erasure codes have different 
performance characteristics than traditional replication and, under some workloads, come at 
some expense. At the same time, we have introduced a storage tiering infrastructure and cache 
pools that allow alternate hardware backends (like high-end flash) to be leveraged for active 
data sets while cold data are transparently migrated to slower backends. The combination of 
these two features enables a surprisingly broad range of new applications and deployment configurations.
This talk will cover a few Ceph fundamentals, discuss the new tiering and erasure coding 
features, and then discuss a variety of ways that the new capabilities can be leveraged.</p>

<p>As the Fedora Project reached its 10th birthday, we starting looking at how computing has 
changed since we started, and what we need to do to stay relevant, useful, and engaging. 
The IT world has become much more developer and application-centric, automation is everywhere, 
and cloud computing brings a whole new scale of operations (along with new privacy and security 
challenges). Personal computing is giving way to mobile. And Linux and open source are 
everywhere — in ways we only dreamed of a decade ago. Fedora had an amazing and successful 
first decade, but as we looked forward, realized that we weren't ideally positioned to 
meet the challenges this new world brings. Our years of hard work created a polished, 
capable, and amazing traditional Linux distribution, but our user and contributor communities 
weren't growing. After much soul-searching on the mailing list and at our contributor conferences,
we knew we had to make some changes. We also knew that we wanted to stay true to our core values — 
freedom, friends, features, and first — and we didn't want to turn back on the things we've gotten 
right. So, we worked on several initiatives under the umbrella term "Fedora.next". This includes 
the separate Fedora Cloud, Fedora Workstation, and Fedora Server flavors, constructed to fit 
specific user bases and use cases in a way we've never done before. And it includes a more 
ambitious plan to decompose the thousands of packages in the Fedora repository into modular 
components in a "ring" structure. It also comes with a new governance model — the consensus-based 
and objective-oriented Fedora Council. Matthew Miller, the Fedora Project Leader, will talk about 
all of these things and about where we might be going next, and will answer your questions about 
anything and everything Fedora related.</p>
