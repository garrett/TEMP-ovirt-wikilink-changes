<h1 id="ovirt-362-release-notes">OVirt 3.6.2 Release Notes</h1>

<p>The oVirt Project is pleased to announce the availability of oVirt 3.6.2 release as of January 26th, 2016.</p>

<p>oVirt is an open source alternative to VMware vSphere, and provides an awesome KVM management interface for multi-node virtualization. This release is available now for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, CentOS Linux 6.7 (or similar) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2, CentOS Linux 7.2 (or similar).</p>

<p>To find out more about features which were added in previous oVirt releases, check out the <a href="/develop/release-management/releases/">previous versions release notes</a>. For a general overview of oVirt, read <a href="/documentation/quickstart/quickstart-guide/"> the Quick Start Guide</a> and the <a href="/documentation/introduction/about-ovirt/">about oVirt</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="install--upgrade-from-previous-versions">Install / Upgrade from previous versions</h2>

<h3 id="fedora--centos--rhel">Fedora / CentOS / RHEL</h3>

<p>In order to install it on a clean system, you need to install</p>

<p><code># yum localinstall </code><a href="http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm"><code>http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release36.rpm</code></a></p>

<p>If you are upgrading from a previous version, you may have the ovirt-release35 package already installed on your system. You can then install ovirt-release36.rpm as in a clean install side-by-side.</p>

<p>Once ovirt-release36 package is installed, you will have the ovirt-3.6-stable repository and any other repository needed for satisfying dependencies enabled by default.</p>

<p>If you're installing oVirt 3.6.2 on a clean host, you should read our <a href="/documentation/quickstart/quickstart-guide/">Quick Start Guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you are upgrading from oVirt &lt; 3.5.0, you must first upgrade to oVirt 3.5.0 or later. Please see <a href="/develop/release-management/releases/3.5.6/">oVirt 3.5.6 Release Notes</a> for upgrade instructions.</p>

<p>For upgrading now you just need to execute:</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>  # yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*"&#x000A;  # engine-setup&#x000A;</code></pre>

<h3 id="ovirt-hosted-engine">oVirt Hosted Engine</h3>

<p>If you're going to install oVirt as Hosted Engine on a clean system please follow <a href="/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#Fresh_Install">Hosted_Engine_Howto#Fresh_Install</a> guide.</p>

<p>If you're upgrading an existing Hosted Engine setup, please follow <a href="/documentation/how-to/hosted-engine/#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine">Hosted_Engine_Howto#Upgrade_Hosted_Engine</a> guide.</p>

<h3 id="ovirt-live">oVirt Live</h3>

<p>A new oVirt Live ISO is available at:</p>

<p><a href="http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/"><code>http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.6/iso/ovirt-live/</code></a></p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-362">What's New in 3.6.2?</h2>

<p><b>Provided feedback about the status of the recovery</b>
More logs have been added improving feedback during the recovery flow helping the administrator understanding what VDSM is doing during the recovery, and providing progress report.
 <b>Rebalance option have been disabled on the menu for non-distributed volumes</b>
 <b>Host in maintenance mode now stop glusterd and glusterfsd processes</b>
 <b>Host activation now restart glusterd</b>
 <b>DNF support</b>
ovirt-engine-setup used to rely on yum compatibility layer to work on recent distributions that comes with DNF package manager installed by default. Now it can work directly with DNF package manager.
 <b>MOM performance have been improved</b>
 <b>Added the ability to override the Storage Domain name field</b>
This changed field will be reflected in the engine DB and in the GUI but will not get updated in the Storage Domain metadata until the user will update the Storage Domain once it is active.
Once a Storage Domain will be imported, if the name field will be blank then the value from the Storage Domain metadata will be initialized, otherwise the fields which were provided in the user request will be used.</p>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>engine-setup –offline does not update versionlock
Cause: a bug in engine-setup running in offline mode</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequence: cause version lock wasn't written inside the appliance on versions &lt; 3.6.2: yum update cause ovirt-engine packages to be updated without a database update by engine-setup.</p>

<p>Workaround (if any): avoid to use –offline on verson &lt; 3.6.2; in hosted-engine deployment with the appliance avoid to use the automatic setup. When upgrading appliance from a previous version to 3.6.2 be sure to upgrade setup packages only: yum update "ovirt-engine-setup*" and then run engine-setup.</p>
